#  1.0.0 (2023-04-02)

### Bug fixes


### Breaking changes

1. The server requests to `generate a license file` and `confuse` it.
2. The client `generates a unique` feature code according to the `mac address` of the `local network card`, and sends it to the server to `generate a license file`.
3. After the client gets the `license file`, it verifies the `signature`.
4. The obfuscated `license content` is increased to `5496 bits`.
